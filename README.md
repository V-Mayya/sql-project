‣ Given the recent wildfires in Australia, heat wave in Europe and other natural disasters over the years, my project will be exploring the impact and methods that nations have used to deal with the aftermath of such disasters. 

‣ It will specifically focus on types of key natural disasters during the years of 2000-2022 (along with their magnitudes), events, number of fatalities, the recovery period, economic impact, support after the disaster and others.

‣ The idea to create a project based around natural disasters was developed after reading the book 'Extreme Economies'. One of the incidents described in the book was about how Aceh (a province of Indonesia) managed to resume its daily operations almost immediately after disaster struck. 

‣ The economic resilience and methods the region used to dampen the impact of the natural disaster inspired me to create this project.
